🚀 Overview
DetectAI is a full-stack, real-time image recognition platform that combines modern frontend design with high-performance backend AI. Built with React for the UI and FastAPI + PyTorch for inference, it delivers a seamless user experience with cutting-edge AI capabilities — fully responsive, mobile-friendly, and Docker-ready for deployment anywhere.

🌟 Key Features
✨ Ultra-Modern UI
Dark mode theme with glassmorphism, neon glow, and animated buttons

Fully responsive design across desktops, tablets, and smartphones

Smooth Lottie animations for dynamic feedback

🖼️ Instant Image Upload & Preview
Drag-and-drop or traditional file browsing

Live image thumbnail shown before prediction

Placeholder with glowing “Upload Here” prompt

🤖 High-Performance AI
Powered by a custom-trained deep learning model

⚙️ Custom ResNet50 CNN trained on 100 diverse image classes

🧠 Checkpoint resume + mixed-precision training (AMP) for efficiency

🧊 Optimized for low VRAM GPUs (e.g. RTX 2050 4GB)

🧪 Clean model packaging with torch.load() for fast inference

⚡ Lightning-Fast Prediction
⚡ Uses torch.no_grad() for inference

✅ Asynchronous FastAPI endpoints

🔍 Returns top-3 predictions with confidence scores

🔄 Image pre-processing pipeline using PIL & torchvision

🐳 Docker-Ready Deployment
📦 Prebuilt Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml

Includes production-ready setup with Nginx reverse proxy

Run with a single command: docker-compose up --build

🔄 CI/CD Integration
✅ GitHub Actions for linting, test builds, and deploy pipeline

🐳 Auto-build and push Docker images to Docker Hub or GHCR

💡 Ideal for staging → production workflows

🛠️ Tech Stack
Layer	Tech Used
Frontend	React.js, Tailwind CSS (or CSS modules), Lottie
Backend	FastAPI, Python, PyTorch
AI Model	ResNet50, TorchVision, PIL

⚙️ Local Development
📦 Backend (FastAPI + PyTorch)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend/
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
💻 Frontend (React)
bash
Copy
Edit
cd frontend/
npm install
npm run dev
📤 Docker Setup
To run the app in containers:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up --build
The frontend is served via Nginx, and the backend runs on Uvicorn inside the API container.
